# Innovative Drone Insurance Pricing Model

This is an innovative drone insurance pricing model developed during the Hacklytics event at Georgia Tech, where it emerged as the Track Winner for Assurantâ€™s Challenge #2. This project optimizes the conventional approach to drone insurance pricing, offering a predictive analysis model that not only enhances accuracy but also provides significant cost reductions ranging from 5% to 30%.

It's is my own spin-off to the original version developed by me and my teammate called **FlightShield** (https://github.com/Shaashvat01/FlightShield).

## Awards and Recognition
- **Hackathon:** Hacklytics at Georgia Tech 2024
- **Track:** Assurant Insurance
- **Placement:** 1st position

## Key Achievements
- **Predictive Analysis Model:** Engineered a predictive analysis model for drone insurance pricing using SAS. This model synthesizes datasets from competitors' quotation systems to identify essential variables and weightages, enabling precise evaluations and enhancing pricing competitiveness.

- **Pilot Rating System:** Introduced an innovative pilot rating system that dynamically adjusts insurance rates based on flight performance. Leveraging DJI logs, this system ensures fairness in charges by tailoring premiums to individual pilots' skill levels and risk profiles.

- **Machine Learning for Risk Assessment:** Developed a machine learning model to evaluate the proximity of risky environments, enabling accurate assessment of insurance charges based on the flight context. This approach enhances risk management strategies and ensures fair pricing for drone operators.

## Next Steps
The Flight Shield team is committed to further enhancing the project by implementing a full stack solution. This includes integrating the predictive analysis model, pilot rating system, and risk assessment algorithms into a comprehensive platform that provides seamless drone insurance services.

## Technologies Used
- SAS
- Machine Learning (ML)
- DJI Logs Analysis
- Python for Synthetic Databases
- Full Stack Development (planned)
